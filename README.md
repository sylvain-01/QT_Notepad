# Qt Notepad

Created a notepad with the Qt framework on windows 10 using Qt Quick application and the user interface designer tool tool along with some C++ code and some added icon images. Notepad has all the functions such as file menu, edit menu and about menu and includes actions such as new, open, save, save as, print, copy, paste, undo, redo, bold font, italic font and info. Also have a toolbar with shortcut images to click on. My project contains a total of 6 files that include: notepad.pro, mainwindow.h, main.cpp, mainwindow.cpp, mainwindow.ui and resource.qrc and one folder that contains images for icon shortcuts.
